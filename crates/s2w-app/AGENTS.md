# s2w-app

Runtime wiring: composes sources, the log, the core and the engines; read-only MCP; local web view.

## Allowed dependencies

- every `s2w-*` library crate; `tokio`, `tokio-stream`, `thiserror`; further runtime, MCP and
  HTTP libraries chosen in decision records

The enforced list is `xtask/allowlist.toml`; `cargo xtask check` fails on anything else. Layer rules: `docs/decisions/0001-workspace-layers.md`.

## Invariants

- The only crate that composes layers. Business rules live in the core, not here.
- MCP is read-only; capabilities never expand from a good track record.
- Local by default: nothing leaves the machine without an approved export manifest.
- A stored cursor beats `--since`: passing both is a usage error, never a silent ignore, and a
  cursor that cannot be decoded is a loud error, never a fresh start.
- The System 1 bridge (`bridge/`, decision 0011) writes to `QueryState` only through
  `append`, resumes from a log position (never a fold offset), and refuses a non-empty timeline.
- `query/` is the one read contract for the view, `--json` and MCP (decision 0006). Its pure half does no
  I/O; the HTTP half only parses parameters and calls it. One SSE message per offset; stable error codes.
